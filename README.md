## Introduction

In this commit, I've integrated the Hacker News (HN) API, which is built on top of Algolia Search's API, enabling developers to access HN data programmatically using a REST API. This documentation describes how to request data from the API and how to interpret the response.

Additionally, I've implemented Chakra UI for a modern and responsive user interface, providing a consistent and visually appealing design for our application. Chakra UI simplifies styling and theming, making it easier to create a polished user experience.

To manage the state and data flow in the application, I've also incorporated React Context. This allows for efficient data sharing and global state management, improving the overall performance and maintainability of the project.
